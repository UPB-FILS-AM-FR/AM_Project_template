## Description
ESP32 Led Webserver

An ESP32 LED Webserver is a project where an ESP32 microcontroller is programmed to control an LED (or multiple LEDs) via a web interface. The ESP32 acts as both the server and the controller, serving web pages to connected clients (such as a computer, smartphone, or tablet). These web pages provide an interface that allows users to interact with the LEDs, typically to turn them on or off, change their brightness, or alter their color (if RGB LEDs are used).
## Motivation
Building an ESP32 LED Webserver is a highly educational and practical project that bridges the gap between embedded systems and web development. It provides a hands-on approach to learning about microcontrollers, IoT, and web technologies while creating a functional and customizable device that can be expanded upon for various applications in home automation and beyond
